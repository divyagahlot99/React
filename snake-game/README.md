# Snake game

### About the mini-project

This was a failed attempt at creating this app in React (damn!). This, in a nutshell is a small snake-game project made using purely Javascript and a little css (No react, I know!). May have many mistakes, cause this is solely for learning and experimenting purposes.

To run it in your machine, simply download the folder `snake-game`

Once you do it, run the `index.html` file and you should see the application running.
